- Found the following (possibly) invalid URLs:
     URL: https://codecov.io/gh/ThinkR-open/fusen (moved to
https://app.codecov.io/gh/ThinkR-open/fusen)
       From: README.md
       Status: 301
       Message: Moved Permanently

Please change http --> https, add trailing slashes, or follow moved
content as appropriate.

Please fix and resubmit.

=> Thank you. Sorry for the redirections, I do not always find the correct combination for codecov...
I followed the URL to use a not redirected content: `[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/ThinkR-open/fusen/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://app.codecov.io/gh/ThinkR-open/fusen)`  
I did not find 'http' calls though
