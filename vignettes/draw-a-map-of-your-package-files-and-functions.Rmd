# Get a tree of the package structure to help developers

`get_package_structure()` is a function that helps developers understand the package structure. It reads the `dev/config_fusen.yaml` file, adds the list of resulting functions and extra description of files.  

You can know:

- The description of the flat file as issued from its Title when exists
- If the flat file is still active
- The list of R files issued from the flat file
- The list of functions inside these R files
- The list of files of tests issued from the flat file
- There is a possibility to list all functions that are called in the test files
- The vignette issued from the flat file

With `draw_the_map()`, you can draw a tree of the package structure in the console.

```{r examples-get_package_structure}
#| eval: no

#' \dontrun{
#' # This only works inside a 'fusen' built package
#' pkg_structure <- get_package_structure()
#' draw_the_tree(pkg_structure)
#' }
#'
#' # Example with a dummy package
dummypackage <- tempfile("drawpkg.structure")
dir.create(dummypackage)

# {fusen} steps
fill_description(pkg = dummypackage, fields = list(Title = "Dummy Package"))
dev_file <- suppressMessages(
  add_flat_template(pkg = dummypackage, overwrite = TRUE, open = FALSE)
)
flat_file <- dev_file[grepl("flat_", dev_file)]

usethis::with_project(dummypackage, {
  suppressMessages(
    inflate(
      pkg = dummypackage, flat_file = flat_file,
      vignette_name = "Get started", check = FALSE,
      open_vignette = FALSE
    )
  )

  pkg_structure <- get_package_structure()
  draw_the_tree(pkg_structure)
})
```



# Get the list of functions from a R file
    
  
```{r example-get_all_created_funs}
file_path <- tempfile(fileext = ".R")
cat(
  "my_fun <- function() {1}",
  "my_fun2 <- function() {2}",
  sep = "\n",
  file = file_path
)
get_all_created_funs(file_path)
```
