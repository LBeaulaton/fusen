## Protect existing R, tests and vignettes files

`df_to_config()` allows to add your own list of files that you want to `keep` in your package, despite not beeing created with a flat file.  
This is important if you started to develop without {fusen}, and start using a flat file from now on, so that {fusen} does not delete your existing files.


```{r examples-df_to_config, eval = FALSE}
# Add your own list of files to "keep", 
# if they are not in a flat file.
# Otherwise, they may be deleted with your next `inflate()`
my_files_to_protect <- tibble::tribble(
  ~type, ~path,
  "R", "R/zaza.R",
  "R", "R/zozo.R",
  "test", "tests/testthat/test-zaza.R",
  "vignette", "vignettes/my-zaza-vignette.Rmd"
)

# \dontrun{
df_to_config(my_files_to_protect)
# }

```

## List files that are not registered in config

    
`not_registered_files()` list files that are not already registered in the yaml config file.


  

```{r example-not_registered_files}
not_registered_files()
```

  

  

# clean_fusen_files

    

  

```{r example-clean_fusen_files}
clean_fusen_files()
```
