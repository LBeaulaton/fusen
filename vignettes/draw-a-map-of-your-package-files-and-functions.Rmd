# Map the package structure to help developers

`map_the_package()` is a function that helps developers understand the package structure. It reads the `dev/config_fusen.yaml` file, adds the list of resulting functions and extra description of files.  

You can know:

- The description of the flat file as issued from its Title when exists
- If the flat file is still active
- The list of R files issued from the flat file
- The list of functions inside these R files
- The list of files of tests issued from the flat file
- There is a possibility to list all functions that are called in the test files
- The vignette issued from the flat file

#' # This only works inside a 'fusen' built package
#' map <- map_the_package()
#' draw_the_map(map)

#' # Example with a dummy package
dummypackage <- tempfile("drawmap")
dir.create(dummypackage)

# {fusen} steps
fill_description(pkg = dummypackage, fields = list(Title = "Dummy Package"))

# Get the list of functions from a R file
    
  
```{r example-get_all_created_funs}

  "my_fun <- function() {1}",
  "my_fun2 <- function() {2}",
  sep = "\n",
