<!-- WARNING - This vignette is generated by {fusen} from dev/flat_inflate_all.Rmd: do not edit by hand -->

This vignette details the process used to be able to inflate all the flat files present in the `dev/` folder at once.

Prior to be able to inflate all the flat files, some checks are performed.

The function `pre_inflate_all_diagnosis()` performs a diagnosis to assess whether the flat files are available to be used by `inflate_all()`. 

Please note that `inflate_all()` requires the existence of a `config_fusen.yml` file. This file is not existing in versions of {fusen} prior to v0.5.0.9000.

If you are working in a project initiated with a version of {fusen} prior to v0.5.0.9000, please run `inflate()` for at least one of your flat files in order to create the `config_fusen.yml` file.

If you are already familiar to `config_fusen.yml` but were working with a dev version of {fusen} prior to v0.5.0.9001, your `config_fusen.yml` file does not contain inflate-related parameters. You will have to inflate again you flat files in order to complete `config_fusen.yml` with the `inflate()` parameters.
